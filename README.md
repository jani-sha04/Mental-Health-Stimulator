- **Struct**: `MoodEntry` structure for organized data storage
- **String**: User input handling and text processing

### Algorithms Implemented
- **Random Selection**: For motivational quote generation
- **Frequency Analysis**: Mood pattern tracking and statistics
- **Search Algorithm**: Date-based mood entry retrieval
- **Sorting & Comparison**: Finding most common moods using `max_element`
- **String Processing**: Case-insensitive mood matching

### Key Programming Concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- STL (Standard Template Library) usage
- File I/O concepts (timestamp generation)
- Menu-driven programming
- Error handling and input validation

## üöÄ Getting Started

- Basic understanding of command line operations

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Local Development
1. **Clone or Download** the source code
2. **Save** the code as `mental_health_simulator.cpp`
3. **Compile** using your preferred method:

**Using GCC/MinGW:**
```bash
g++ -o mental_health_simulator mental_health_simulator.cpp
```

**Using Visual Studio:**
```bash
cl mental_health_simulator.cpp
```

4. **Run** the executable:
```bash
./mental_health_simulator        # Linux/Mac
mental_health_simulator.exe     # Windows
```

#### Option 2: Online Compilers

## üé® Sample Output

```
üåü Welcome to Mental Health Companion üåü
=========================================

This is a safe space for you to track your mental wellness.
Please enter your name: Alex

Hello, Alex! It's wonderful to have you here.

Would you like to start a wellness session? (y/n): y

üå∏ Starting your wellness session...
=====================================

How are you feeling right now?
You can describe your mood in your own words: anxious

Thank you for sharing, Alex.

üí≠ Here's a message for you:
"You are stronger than you think and more capable than you imagine."

üßò Recommended calming exercises for you:
==========================================
1. Deep Breathing: Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 6. Repeat 5 times.

2. 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding: Name 5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you touch, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.
```

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Moods
Modify the `initializeMoodExercises()` function to include new mood-exercise pairs:
```cpp
moodExercises["excited"] = {
    "Channel energy: Do a quick energizing activity.",
    "Share enthusiasm: Tell someone about your excitement.",
    // Add more exercises...
};
```

### Adding New Quotes
Extend the `motivationalQuotes` vector in `initializeQuotes()`:
```cpp
motivationalQuotes.push_back("Your custom inspirational quote here.");
```

### Modifying Exercise Recommendations
Update existing mood exercises in the `moodExercises` map to better suit your needs.
